								WHAT IS SIFFX?
						</h2>
						<p>
							SIFFX is a brand-new four-day festival within the Seattle International
							Film Festival showcasing the most current and creative thinking in virtual
							reality, augmented reality and 360° immersion. Building on SIFF’s commitment
							to fostering cinematic arts and independent filmmaking, SIFFX will convene
							filmmakers, storytellers, activists, artists, creative technicians, and
							educators to explore contemporary forms of new media, exhibit new work,
							experiment with new tools, make connections and dig into the question:
							How can we shape the purpose, use, and language of an entirely new
							medium at this pivotal moment in storytelling?

						<h2>
							WHY HERE? WHY NOW?
						</h2>
						<p>
							As a renowned hive of tech innovation that also boasts a thriving DIY arts
							community, Seattle is perfectly positioned to host the SIFFX festival
							in 2016. VR, AR and 360° video are rocketing forward this year in
							terms of both the variety and accessibility of these new
							technologies—evidenced in part by the fact that the biggest streaming
 							media companies (YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, etc.) have already or will soon
							release 360º functionality. But without VR-literate makers forging a
							breadth of compelling content—from artistic and entertaining to
							urgent and compelling—may end up being more gimmicky than groundbreaking.
							Now is the moment we must engage critical conversations about the
							intersection of technology, journalism, cinematic arts and beyond. SIFFX
							brings all these stakeholders together with the goal of shaping the
							future of this new era in storytelling.
