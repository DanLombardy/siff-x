			eventHeader:'NONNY DE LA PEÑA RETROSPECTIVE',
			eventDescription: "View an unprecedented retrospective of work by Nonny de la Peña, the “Godmother of VR,” that shows both her innovation and how far we’ve come in terms of technological capabilities. On view is her first piece, Hunger in Los Angeles, an immersive journalistic experience embedded with actual audio from a food bank line, where indigent people are just trying to survive in the city. For this piece, de la Peña’s young intern, Lucky Palmer, developed a prototype headset—which he later evolved into the Oculus Rift. Also on display are de la Peña’s virtual reality pieces Project Syria, which plunges viewers into a bombing in Aleppo, and Kiya, about two sisters trying to rescue a third from domestic violence.",
